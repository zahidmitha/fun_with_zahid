# Extra Credit

# ten_things.split(' ') is the equivalent of split(ten_things, ' ')
# next_one = more_stuff.pop() is the equivalent of pop(next_one, )
# stuff.append(next_one) is append(stuff, next_one)
# stuff.pop() is pop(stuff,  )
# ' '.join(stuff) is ' '.join(stuff) NB: It doesn't change. 
# '#'.join(stuff[3:5]) is equivalent of join('#', stuff[3:5])

# A class is http://www.sthurlow.com/python/lesson08/. It's like a tenplate that allows functionss and varibales that are closely related to interact.

#DIR(object) lists the valid attributes for an object, such as a class. i.e. it gives us the class' attributes.
